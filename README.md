This project is a fully functional calculator application designed to perform essential arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS to ensure a responsive and user-friendly experience, while the core logic is implemented using JavaScript. Users can interact with the calculator using both mouse clicks and keyboard input, with full support for the decimal point and the backspace key. A key feature is the display of the current operation history, which allows users to quickly reference previous calculations. The application is designed to be intuitive and reliable for all basic mathematical needs.
